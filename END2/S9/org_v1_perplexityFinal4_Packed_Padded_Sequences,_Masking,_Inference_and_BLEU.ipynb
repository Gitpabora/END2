It will give us a number between 0 and 1 for each sequence, where 1 means there is perfect overlap, i.e. a perfect translation, although is usually shown between 0 and 100. BLEU was designed for multiple candidate translations per source sequence, however in this dataset we only have one candidate per source.\n","\n","We define a `calculate_bleu` function which calculates the BLEU score over a provided TorchText dataset. This function creates a corpus of the actual and predicted translation for each source sentence and then calculates the BLEU score."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FObjviUsvmlj","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1625997366698,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":29,"user":{"displayName":"parinita bora","photoUrl":"","userId":"11663973723666390448"}}},"source":["from torchtext.data.metrics import bleu_score\n","\n","def calculate_bleu(data, model, device, max_len = 50):\n","    \n","    trgs = []\n","    pred_trgs = []\n","\n","\n","    for src, trg in data:\n","      \n","        pred_trg, _ = translate_sentence(src, model, device, max_len)\n","        \n","        #cut off <eos> token\n","        pred_trg = pred_trg[:-1]\n","        \n","        pred_trgs.append(pred_trg)\n","        trgs.append([trg])\n","        \n","    return bleu_score(pred_trgs, trgs)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZUE5Bayc4HeZ"},"source":["### Calculate BLEU score"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AxJFn90wvmlk","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1625997366698,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":29,"user":{"displayName":"parinita bora","photoUrl":"","userId":"11663973723666390448"}}},"source":["#bleu_score = calculate_bleu(test_data, SRC, TRG, model, device)\n","test_data = Multi30k(split= 'test' , language_pair=(SRC_LANGUAGE, TGT_LANGUAGE))\n","#test_dataloader = DataLoader(test_data, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, collate_fn=collate_fn)\n","\n","bleu_score = calculate_bleu(test_data, model, device)\n","\n","print(f'BLEU score = {bleu_score*100:.2f}')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EsYZyrE4vmll"},"source":["In the next tutorials we will be moving away from using recurrent neural networks and start looking at other ways to construct sequence-to-sequence models.
